# Selma's HW1 Semantic Refactor

## Description 

In this homework, we are given an already built out website. This website is built using mostly div tags. Div tags are not the best tags to use in regards to semantic or accessible HTML because they don't give any context as to the type of content being added to the website. The task we had in this homework was to change the existing code to be more accessible and to utilize semantic html tags like header, footer, main, aside, section, etc in place of div or span. These semantic tags give accessibility and understanding as to what content to expect in the case of users with disabilities or screen readers. 

I was motivated by having the highest Lighthouse score in my developer tools for accessibility and SEO. Having the highest Lighthouse score for these things will make the website more accessible to people with disabilities and screen readers. We are not all able-bodied, and we must strive to make our web accessible to every person whether someone is blind, color-blind, deaf, has poor internet connection, etc.

A couple of things I learned in this:
**Pseudoclasses, primarily the hover pseudoclass
*SEO metadata
*The difference between an alt tag and an aria tag
*To commit multiple times so you can revert back with a pull if you need to
*I learned the hard way that I was working straight out of the class repository and a git pull for class eliminated all my homework. So I also learned to organize my own local folders better and to keep an eye on what file path shows up on my Visual Studio.

The hardest thing for me was deciding when to use the tags section, article, figure, etc. It's very hazy to me how those are different, so I will need to continue understanding that.
